this grunt thing was made mostly for resizing the cover images for stories on Love nicely

the images need to be resized so smaller images load on small screens, increasing the speed at which the page loads as well as saving bandwidth and processing power

the standard image sizes we need are as follows:
- 2560px width (very large screens)
- 1400px width (tablets and desktops)
- 640px width (large phones)
- 320px width (mobile)





for now, this task works as a simple replacement for editing the images in photoshop. it's not built into the build process yet though because there.. is no build process yet.
